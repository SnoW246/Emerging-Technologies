# Emerging Technologies
Emerging Technologies module is part of my [B.Sc. (Hons) in Software Development](https://www.gmit.ie/software-development/bachelor-science-honours-software-development) studies at [Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology](http://www.gmit.ie/)

This repository consists of set of solutions to [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) and [Jupiter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) problem sheets which can all be found in the following sub-folders of the repository:
  1. [Python-Fundamentals](https://github.com/SnoW246/Emerging-Technologies/tree/master/Python-Fundamentals)
  2. [MINST Data Sets](https://github.com/SnoW246/Emerging-Technologies/tree/master/MINST%20Data%20Sets)
  3. [Jupyter, Numpy & Pyplot](https://github.com/SnoW246/Emerging-Technologies/tree/master/Jupyter%2C%20Numpy%20%26%20Pyplot)

## What is Emerging Technologies Module?
It is a subject to introduce new and emerging technologies in computing. Technologies such as new programming languages, new types of data structures, new types of software infrastructure, and new communications protocols.

## What are it's learning outcomes?
This module is designed to allow individuals to be able to do the following:
* Quickly adapt to new programming languages and styles.
* Discuss and explain proposed new web technology standards.
* Identify new types of applications that can be developed using newly available data infrastructures.
* Utilise new systems and frameworks to analyse data.

# Emerging Technologies is to bring in dept understanding in the following fields:
## 1. Programming languages
  * Comparison of current industry-standard programming languages.
  * Consideration of emerging programming languages and their goals.
  * Quickly learning new programming languages.
  * Programming language selection. 
## 2. Data analysis
  * Comparison of current data analytics infrastructures.
  * Consideration of emerging data analytics infrastructures.
  * Refactoring of data.
## 3. Emerging standards
  * Review of existing web standards and protocols.
  * Introduction to emerging web standards and protocols.
